# What is this project?
This project is a command line tool built in zig. Its capabilities will include generating keys, encrypting files, and decrypting files according to DES (Data encryption standard). 
This standard is no longer considered secure, and has been superceded by AES. This project is not meant to be used for sensitive information. This is a learning project. 

# Why is this project?
I am currently taking a network security class and we learned about DES. I thought that it looked sufficiently complex to implement to be a fun project.
Also, I am interested in learning Zig, and I thought this could be a great way to do that as well. 

# Where did I learn to implement this?
I found a great article explaining in English how the DES algorithm works by J. Orlin Grabbe from Technical University Berlin. Here is a link to that article: https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~kant/teaching/hess/krypto-ws2006/des.htm
This article has no code or pseudocode, only an in-English explanation along with plenty of examples of inputs and outputs of various functions and permutations. I used this as a guide to build this project.
